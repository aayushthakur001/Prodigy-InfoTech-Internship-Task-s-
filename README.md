## 📂 Detailed Task Descriptions

### 🔹 Task 01 — Caesar Cipher
- Encrypts and decrypts text using the **Caesar Cipher algorithm**.
- Features:
  - User selects **Encrypt/Decrypt**
  - Shift value customizable
  - Interactive CLI + Argparse CLI support
  - Exports results to a `.txt` file
- **Banner** included with Developer's Codename.

---

### 🔹 Task 02 — Pixel Manipulation Image Encryptor
- Encrypts images by manipulating pixel values via XOR operation.
- Features:
  - Supports `.jpg`, `.png`, etc.
  - Encryption & decryption using a numeric **key** (0–255).
  - Interactive CLI + Command-line Mode
- **Security Tip:** Use the same key for decryption!

---

### 🔹 Task 03 — Password Strength Checker
- Checks password strength based on:
  - Length
  - Uppercase letters
  - Lowercase letters
  - Digits
  - Special Characters
- Provides detailed **feedback** on how to improve password security.
- Supports CLI and interactive usage.

---

### 🔹 Task 04 — Ethical Keylogger
- Captures and logs keystrokes.
- Saves data to a local `.txt` file.
- Features:
  - Captures all visible characters
  - Handles special keys (Enter, Space, etc.)
  - Ethical use emphasized (personal or authorized machines only)

---

### 🔹 Task 05 — Advanced Network Packet Sniffer
- Captures live network traffic.
- Displays:
  - Source IP
  - Destination IP
  - Protocol (TCP, UDP, ICMP)
  - Payload data (first 50 bytes)
- Extra Features:
  - Save packets into a `.pcap` file (openable via Wireshark)
  - Filter packets (e.g., only TCP, only ICMP)
  - Detect HTTP GET/POST requests in payloads
  - Real-time Dashboard Design (optional with curses)
- Built with **professional CLI arguments** and **live output**.
- **Security Tip:** Only capture traffic on networks you own or have explicit permission to monitor!
